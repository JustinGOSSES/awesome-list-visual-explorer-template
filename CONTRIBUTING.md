# Welcome!
This project `IF THE README IS awsome-list-visual-explorer-template !!!` is currently a side project by me, Justin Gosses, but I'm very open to anyone else contributing to building out this project and expanding on some of the ideas! This project was started in spring 2021 and I seem to have time to work on it every couple of months.

## Unexpected Wait Times
I'm pretty good at responding to issues and pull requests within a couple days at most. However, I have at times gotten swamped and things get missed. Feel free to tag an issue or pull request with an emoji to get it to pop up in my feed again. You can also probably find my email with a tiny bit of sleuthing given the rare combination of first name and last name.
