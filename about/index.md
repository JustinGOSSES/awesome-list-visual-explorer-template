### What is this?
This webpage was built from a template that automates the process of creating visualizations that make it easier to understand the trends and connections between a group of GitHub code repositories documented in an Awesome List, or otherwise included in configuration files.

#### Why Visualize Awesome Lists?

Within smaller communities it can be difficult to find applicable open source code for your problem. A lot of what code you use is based on word of mouth and stumbling upon someone else's repository working on similar problems. This can be inefficient. 

<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Awesome lists</a> are a great way to source code specific to a domain, problem, or use case that others think is "awesome". 

Awesome Lists have limits in that they don't show connections between projects or directly show you how popularity of projects might have changed over time. These are some of the things this project seeks to make a little easier!

More information can be found in the README for the template at <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/awesome-list-visual-explorer-template">https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/awesome-list-visual-explorer-template</a>
