### What is this?
This webpage was built from a template that automates the process of creating visualizations that make it easier to understand the trends and connections between a group of GitHub code repositories documented in an Awesome List, or otherwise included in configuration files.

#### Why Visualize Awesome Lists?

Within smaller communities it can be difficult to find applicable open source code for your problem. A lot of what code you use is based on word of mouth and stumbling upon someone else's repository working on similar problems. This can be inefficient. 

<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Awesome lists</a> are a great way to source code specific to a domain, problem, or use case that others think is "awesome". 

Awesome Lists have limits in that they don't show connections between projects or directly show you how popularity of projects might have changed over time. These are some of the things this project seeks to make a little easier!

More information can be found in the README for the template at <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/awsome-list-visual-explorer-template">https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/awsome-list-visual-explorer-template</a>

### When was it created?
It was initially created as part of the Transform 21' hackathon put on by The Software Underground or SWUNG.


### What is SWUNG? 
SWUNG, or the Software Underground, is a digital first non-profit society focused on code & rocks. To quote <a href="https://softwareunderground.org/">their front page</a>:
```
The place for scientists and engineers that love rocks and computers. The Software Underground is a grass-roots community of digital subsurface professionals. We are academic and applied geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and others — Welcome!
```

### What is it based off of?
This site was created by taking a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's open source software catalog</a> and changing <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/open_geosciene_code_projects_viz">a bunch of stuff</a> to make it useful for SWUNG.


### Where to get more information
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/open_geosciene_code_projects_viz">README</a>.


### How to get additional code repositories tracked
Check out the instructions in this <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/open_geosciene_code_projects_viz/issues/5">issue</a>.

Also, the plan is to eventually automatically pull in any repository that on github.com that is a part of <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience">AWESOME OPEN GEOSCIENCE</a> awesome list. Awesome lists are a standardized way to share code that many people think is useful to a particular problem, domain, or use case.


### How to contribute code improvements
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/open_geosciene_code_projects_viz/projects/1">issue board </a>. There will be a separate contributions instructions soonish.

### Possible roadmap & ways to use in future
- Add CI/CD automation such that any changes in <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience">AWESOME OPEN GEOSCIENCE</a> awesome list show up here. 
- Better document all the changes between the original LLNL software catalog and here in order to help others replace using these code to understand  other communities.  -->

<!-- **Collaboration fuels our culture.**

Welcome to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) software portal&mdash;a hub for open source software (OSS) produced at the Lab.

LLNL developers create and evolve software on a daily basis. Some of this software is used only internally; other components are licensed for use by external partners and collaborators; and still other software is released and actively developed out in the open on software-hosting platforms. This website is the gateway to all of it.

LLNL is a Department of Energy (DOE) institution, so we abide by the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov) that guides release of open source software (OSS). And not just because we have to but because we *want* to. Long before GitHub was founded, [we started releasing software](https://software.llnl.gov/explore/) for public use and collaboration.

We often work with other national labs, universities, and industry partners. Working on these projects is a lot easier when we can share code directly. For example, building the next generation of supercomputers requires collaboration. The [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org) uses OSS to develop the exascale ecosystem of apps, analytics, infrastructure, and so much more. The ECP is tackling a huge range of scientific areas, like precision medicine and nuclear physics. Future breakthroughs will likely owe some debt to the best practices and accelerated development made possible by OSS.

One of the great things about a large government organization is that we’re not motivated by profit. “The greater good” might sound like a cliché, but it’s true. LLNL’s national security mission governs our work, so our OSS portfolio of apps, libraries, compilers, and other tools support that mission. This includes everything from monitoring the performance of our supercomputers to making multiphysics codes run more smoothly.

Case in point: The DOE’s [Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Program](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/missions/maintaining-stockpile) leverages OSS to build, field, and integrate Linux clusters into production service at our [Livermore Computing supercomputing center](https://hpc.llnl.gov/). ASC is responsible for developing computer simulation capabilities that analyze and predict the performance, safety, and reliability of the nation’s nuclear stockpile. In other words, the stakes are high for ensuring our code is accurate. ASC leadership joined the DOE’s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research to establish a policy of using and distributing OSS to achieve the Program’s goals. With OSS, we can develop quickly and choose the best solutions.

This portal abounds with examples of projects that have found a home in the open source community. Access is key, which is why we jumped at the chance to index our software on [Code.gov](https://code.gov). You’ll find our work in the DOE [repo list](https://code.gov/#!/browse-projects?agencies=DOE). You can also browse our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/LLNL), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/llnl), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/llnl).
